# University Courses Fix - Implementation Summary

## The Issue

The university courses tab was empty because the database didn't have the necessary `university_courses` table.

## The Solution

We created a script to initialize the `university_courses` table and imported sample university course data. This fixed the issue and now university courses are visible in the application.

## Steps Taken

1. We identified that the database tables were missing entirely
2. We created the `university_courses` table directly in the database
3. We imported sample university course data using the CSV format

## How To Fix

If you're experiencing this issue, follow these steps:

1. Run the script to create the university courses table:

   ```
   node create-university-courses-tables.js
   ```

2. Import example university courses:

   ```
   node import-university-courses.js
   ```

3. Alternatively, you can use the CSV import functionality in the UI:
   - Go to the University Courses tab
   - Click the "Upload" button
   - Select your university courses CSV file

## CSV Format Requirements

The university courses CSV file should include these columns:

- `Course Title` - The title of the course
- `Department` - The department offering the course (e.g., Computer Science)
- `Course Code` - The course code or number (e.g., CS101)
- `Credits` - The number of credits for the course
- `Professor` - The professor(s) teaching the course

## Next Steps for Application Improvement

1. **Application Setup Scripts**: Create comprehensive database initialization scripts that will automatically set up all required tables when the application is first installed.

2. **Better Error Handling**: Enhance the frontend to show meaningful error messages when required tables are missing instead of showing empty tabs.

3. **Database Health Check**: Implement a database health check that runs on application startup to verify all required tables exist.

4. **Documentation Improvement**: Update the application documentation to include clear database setup instructions.
